Using Cookies for Session Management

	Cookies are small pieces of information that are sent in response from the web server to the client. 
	Cookies are the simplest technique used for storing client state.

	Cookies are stored on client's computer. 
	They have a life span and are destroyed by the client browser at the end of that life span.
	
	Using Cookies for storing client state has one shortcoming though, if the client has turned of COokie 
	saving settings in his browser then, client state can never be saved because the browser will not allow 
	the application to store cookies.
